'''
The Caesar cipher is an ancient encryption algorithm used by Julius Caesar. It
encrypts letters by shifting them over by a
certain number of places in the alphabet. We
call the length of shift the key. For example, if the
key is 3, then A becomes D, B becomes E, C becomes
F, and so on. To decrypt the message, you must shift
the encrypted letters in the opposite direction. This
program lets the user encrypt and decrypt messages
according to this algorithm.

When you run the code, the output will look like this:

Do you want to (e)ncrypt or (d)ecrypt?
> e
Please enter the key (0 to 25) to use.
> 4
Enter the message to encrypt.
> Meet me by the rose bushes tonight.
